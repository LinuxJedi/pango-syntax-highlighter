# Pango Syntax Highligher

This is an incredibly basic tool for Python 2.x I knocked up for use when creating [Pinpoint](https://wiki.gnome.org/Pinpoint) slides with code snippets in.  It takes a given file and using Pygments it converts it into a syntax highlighted Pango compatible output.

Usage example:

```
pangosyntaxhighlight.py cpp myfile.cpp output.txt
```
